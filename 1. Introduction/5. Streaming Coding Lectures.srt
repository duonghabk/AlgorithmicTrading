Hello friends.
1

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:07,440
Some of you have reached out to me saying that some of the coding Videos tend to be blurry.
2

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,070
Let me assure you that every single video, every single lecture of this course has been created at 1080p
3

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,790
resolution which is high definition.
4

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,150
And there is no reason why any of you should have blurriness the in coding videos or any other videos
5

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,730
for that matter. And Udemy has also assured me that they have enabled something called Adaptive
6

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,210
Streaming which means students should be able to stream
7

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,110
the videos of this course at 1080p resolution.
8

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,250
So let me tell you a couple of things that you should be mindful of when you are streaming any videos
9

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,540
of this course.
10

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,690
When you are streaming a course, if you look at the settings button
11

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,560
by default it is at 720p.
12

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,690
So all you need to do is choose the auto stream.
13

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,830
And that actually.....let me make it full screen.
14

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,540
So when you choose auto.
15

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,590
.
16

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,230
The resolution should become better and should be the one that I actually intended for the students
17

18
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,850
to see.
18

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,870
But by default it is at 720p.
19

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:22,080
Actually let me show you how it looks at 720p.
20

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,340
.
21

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,710
.
22

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,700
So if you see these videos are a bit blurry at 720p
23

24
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:36,060
And it may not be very comfortable to view them at 720 so always make sure that you are streaming the
24

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,170
videos especially the coding videos at 1080p
25

26
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,000
.
26

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:47,250
And another thing is that some of you may not be able to stream it at 1080p depending on the Internet
27

28
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,700
connection you have or any bandwidth issues that you may be facing.
28

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,720
So another option is for you to download these lectures especially the coding lectures.
29

30
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:04,410
I have made every single video, every single lecture of this course downloadable so you should be
30

31
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,220
able to download these lectures and then see it offline.
31

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,220
You can have offline viewing privileges as well.
32

33
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,020
So just wanted to make these things clear.
33

34
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,490
None of you should have any issue with the blurriness. If you're still having issues with blurriness
34

35
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,150
reach out to me and I'll make sure that you are not having that issue.
35

36
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,690
.
36

37
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,040
So thanks a lot.
37

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,790
Happy learning.
