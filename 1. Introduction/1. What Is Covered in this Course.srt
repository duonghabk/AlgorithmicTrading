Hello friends.
1

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,290
In this course we'll start from the basics of algorithmic trading and quantitative finance which is
2

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:15,470
extracting data I have spent quite a few videos to help you learn how to extract different kinds of
3

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:22,700
data which includes intraday data daily data monthly data etc. and I've spent a considerable amount of
4

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:30,050
time in this section because you need to have a number of ways by which you can get data programmatically
5

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,390
into your system.
6

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:39,350
So we'll be looking at equity data, commodity data, FOREX data and we'll discuss two main ways of getting
7

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:47,700
data for your program which includes getting data over an API and getting data using web scraping.
8

9
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:55,090
We will look at various Python libraries which help you extract this data for free which includes
9

10
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,410
Panda's data reader, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage and FXCM.
10

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,420
I'll go into more complex examples of extracting data which means data for a number of stocks, data
11

12
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,830
over choppy internet connection etc..
12

13
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,050
Right.
13

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,420
So I have spent a considerable amount of time over this section of the course because I think this is very
14

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,350
important and we'll look into both
15

16
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,900
OHLCV data which you get for stocks which includes open, high, low, close and volume data and fundamental
16

17
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,060
data which includes data from balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement.
17

18
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:38,540
So we'll then move on to coding technical indicators and performing fundamental analysis using Python.
18

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,520
So in this section I'll help you understand both technical analysis and fundamental analysis and for
19

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:55,370
technical indicators we will look into fairly popular TIs which include MACD, RSI,
20

21
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:02,030
ADX, OBV etc. and you'll understand what these are once we are in that section
21

22
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:13,250
we'll also look at the crossovers, slope, signals, momentum, how to translate the working
22

23
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:20,480
of a trader just looking at the chart and trading how you can mimic this behavior using
23

24
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,710
your code etc..
24

25
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,630
And we'll also discuss how to write programs to perform detailed fundamental analysis of stocks which
25

26
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:36,230
will be required for value investing, We will then move on to the business end of the course which will
26

27
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,430
include building trading strategies and performing back testing.
27

28
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,110
If you don't know what is back testing don't worry about it.
28

29
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:50,960
This is one of the very important parts of checking your code and I would consider it as one of
29

30
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:58,030
the most important parts of deploying your algorithmic trading strategy in the real world.
30

31
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,580
So in this section we will look at how to code trading strategies how to perform back testing using
31

32
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:10,190
historical data to test performance of a strategy how to calculate KPI which is extremely important
32

33
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,100
because you need to have a way to measure how your strategy is performing.
33

34
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:21,950
So in this section we will know how to calculate sharpe, sortino, win ratio, CAGR, Volatility
34

35
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,750
etc.
35

36
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:30,740
And we will also look at implementing basic ML trading strategies. This is still a work
36

37
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,890
in progress but I will definitely include a couple of strategies that have some ML aspect into it.
37

38
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:45,410
Then in the final part of the course we'll be using RESTful APIs to build a fully automated trading
38

39
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:45,770
setup.
39

40
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,290
So in this section you will know how you can write the code and then just forget about it.
40

41
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,000
The code will do your trading - it will extract data,
41

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,280
It will connect to the broker's terminal,
42

43
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,560
It will parse the data,
43

44
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,960
It will analyze data,
44

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,650
It will generate trading signal,
45

46
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,580
It will book trades,
46

47
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,050
It will cancel trades,
47

48
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:11,960
It will move your stop losses etc. So in this last section we will build a fully automated trading
48

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,770
bot which will perform all the steps that a trained human can perform for trading purposes.
49

50
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,800
And we will be using FXCM which is a very popular broker for fx trading.
50

51
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,280
we will be using their demo account for testing this live trading and creating this bot.
