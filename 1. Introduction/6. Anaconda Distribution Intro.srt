00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:09,120
Hello friends before you start on discourse I strongly recommend that you install anacondas by and distribution

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:17,600
anacondas it and distribution is a free and open source Python distribution that has a number of libraries

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:27,740
that will be using in this course Anaconda is used extensively by data scientist by quants by researchers

4
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,390
in different areas like biomedical engineering physics and what not.

5
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:40,160
So Anaconda is one of the most popular distributions that is used and I can assure you that it would

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,310
make your life very easy.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,680
It also has a lot of tools that will help you manage the libraries installing stuff on and starting

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,500
stuff and once you start using it you will start appreciating how convenient and easy to use it is right.

9
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,970
So just go to Anaconda right.

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,450
And then based on which our operating system you are having I'm assuming most of you will have been

11
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,450
those are Mac OS right.

12
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:12,910
Just go to whichever OS you have it and then install whatever version that you want.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,080
I would recommend that you go with by three point seven Virgin or R Python 3 virgin and not Python tuition

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,310
because I'm using Python 3.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,220
So once you will download right you will get like a file which is close to 500 and be in your download

16
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,690
folder.

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,530
Right.

18
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,130
Just double click on it and follow all the default steps.

19
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,650
Just choose all the default options and it will install Anaconda on your system.

20
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:44,270
OK so I have already installed it so I'm not going to do that but it's fairly straightforward.

21
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,800
So I hope that you'll will be able to do it.

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,710
Great.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,950
Once you install it I want you to go to Anaconda prompt.

24
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:52,680
Right.

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,160
Anaconda prompt.

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,510
Right.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,060
Or you will get it right.

28
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,320
So what is Anaconda prompt and why do we use it.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,880
So you will see that in the scores I'll be asking you to install a number of libraries right.

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,520
Different lectures will correspond to different libraries.

31
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:08,750
Right.

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,870
So you will have to install a number of libraries.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,970
And this is how you would install it.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,400
So there are two package managers in Anaconda do popular package managers.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,670
One is Pip and one is Canada.

36
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,350
Right.

37
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,370
So you can install any library using either pip or using the.

38
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:37,780
So for example if you want to install pandas right you can simply install that library's by running

39
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,520
this command.

40
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,570
Right Pip and bind us are gonna install pandas.

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,980
So for example if I ask you in one of my lecture that I will be using life in hands or will be using

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,750
cyclone.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,420
Right.

44
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,580
So all you have to do is just search for Pip install life and answer something like that right.

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,070
And then you will get a link of what is the actual command that you need to install that particular

46
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,680
library.

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,100
Right.

48
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:15,190
So it's fairly easy it's it's it's such a display to install libraries these days some libraries can

49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,920
get a bit tricky but I mean I won't really be covering many of those libraries in the schools right

50
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,870
but this is how you install any library.

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,430
I'll stop the video here and then the next lecture video will discuss how to create a virtual environment.

52
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,040
And why do we even need a virtual environment.

53
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,740
So I'll see you in the next lecture video.

54
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,190
Thanks a lot.
