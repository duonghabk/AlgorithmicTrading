1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,000
So as you can figure out this is a course of intermediate level difficulty so it would be great if
1

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,640
you have some Python skills.
2

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,480
Basic Python skills are definitely required without which you will be a bit lost in this course.
3

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,580
So I would urge you to build some level of Python proficiency and when I say Python proficiency
4

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,910
I mean you should be able to understand how to write a function, how to loop through a list,
5

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,890
What are dictionaries etc.
6

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,290
And good to have skills would be you know some familiarity with numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodel
7

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:44,820
sklearn etc. In the code section of my course where I explain in the video how this
8

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,590
code is functioning I will try to explain everything in the code.
9

10
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,690
But if you have some familiarity you will be able to pick these videos pick these lessons
10

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,570
way more quickly than if you are a complete novice.
11

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:06,480
So I would urge you to just brush up your basic Python if you want to extract the most out of this course.
12

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,050
OK.
13

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,220
And some experience in trading is also required because I'll be using stocks, commodity, forex
14

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,890
data etc.
15

16
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,640
So some familiarity with trading parlance will be very appreciated because I'll be using words like
16

17
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,650
high, low, candlesticks, stop loss.
17

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,190
I'll explain what these are
18

19
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,420
But sometimes I may miss it because it's something maybe really basic. For example going long or
19

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,970
going shot etc. So If you have the basic of these trading parlance then that would also be tremendously
20

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,590
helpful. And basic statistics high school level statistics and mathematics is also required for this
21

22
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:44,810
course.
22

23
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,060
So again I will underline that this courses is of intermediate level difficulty.
23

24
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:56,550
So I would urge you to just brush up the areas that we think will be required.
