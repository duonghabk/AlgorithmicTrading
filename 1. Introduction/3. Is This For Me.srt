This course is for a lot of demographics.
1

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:09,570
So if you are a trader who want to automate your trading strategies you will be able to benefit the
2

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,800
most from this course.
3

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,260
If you already have your trading strategy and your trading strategies are live in the market,
4

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:21,360
you are already trading using charts or performing fundamental analysis and if you're looking
5

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,750
for a way to automate your strategy so that you have more time to think about more strategies and think
6

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,630
about more intellectual things then you'll be the demographic that will be most benefited from
7

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,900
this course.
8

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,600
In addition if you are an engineer who wants to build an automated trading station this will also be
9

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,200
very helpful for you.
10

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:48,590
Our data scientists who love to work with data, live streaming financial data, how to make sense of it?
11

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,170
This course
12

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,730
You will also find this course helpful. And anyone who wants to gain an understanding of trading programmatically
13

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,660
or anyone who is curious should be able to find this course useful.
14

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,370
I would like to underscore that this course is not for high frequency traders.
15

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:18,030
So a significant part of algorithmic trading deals with high frequency trading which delves in very
16

17
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:25,010
low latency kind of trading algorithm where the algorithm is making trading decisions in 
17

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,570
milliseconds
18

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,850
So this course doesn't cater to that part of the algorithmic trading
19

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,040
world.
20

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,690
All my strategies that I will discuss in this course will be of medium to high latency.
21

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,370
I just want to make this thing clear at the outset.
