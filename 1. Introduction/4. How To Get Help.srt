This is very important. Because this course is of intermediate level difficulty, you will have
1

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:13,270
questions when I'm explaining. Both in the overview sections and in the coding sections you will have
2

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,810
problems so do post it in the Q&A section.
3

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,220
I regularly review the Q&A section and provide the answers.
4

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,350
But try to make my life a bit easier.
5

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,590
So write a descriptive post in the Q and A section.
6

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,570
For example if you just say something like I'm getting error so I'll not be able to help.
7

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,840
So if you mention what is it that you're trying to do and what are the steps that you took
8

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,490
and what is the error that you're getting.
9

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,740
If you give me the message in this kind of structured format it would really help me to troubleshoot
10

11
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,570
your problem and help you provide the solution for that issue.
11

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,670
Okay?
12

13
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,890
And also I would urge you to spend some time on the Internet trying to find the answer.
13

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,100
And this is one of the most important part by which people learn.
14

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,490
If you're new in the world of coding, if you're starting out, if you're not
15

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,160
an expert in coding etc. You will get into issues you will find errors you will think that you have
16

17
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,280
hit a wall etc.
17

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,490
However now in the in the age of internet help is available everywhere and forums like Stackoverflow,
18

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,800
github, somewhere someone has already had this problem that you are facing and they have discussed about
19

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,530
it and they have found a solution.
20

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,620
And I'll spend some time trying to explain how to get help over stackoverflow
21

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:47,990
etc. and how to access documentation of various Python libraries so I'll be really happy if you
22

23
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,920
are able to pick up this skill at the end of this course of how to seek help from the relevant
23

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,570
forums.
24

25
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,800
So being able to frame the right questions and search for the relevant information is a very important
25

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,630
skill in the world of programming.
26

27
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:09,100
The importance of this aspect cannot be emphasized more so try to get help from
27

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,050
those sources as well.
28

29
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,420
And you can directly drop me a note on my personal email id
29

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,150
I may take some time to get back to you
30

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,790
but I review every single mail that I get in my personal mailbox so you can utilize this avenue as well
31

32
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:32,080
If you have exhausted the previous two avenues and you have not been able to get your answer.
32

33
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,060
I'm really excited that you have enrolled for this course and I hope that we will be able to
33

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,390
make something awesome.
34

35
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,060
So let's jump straight into the course.
