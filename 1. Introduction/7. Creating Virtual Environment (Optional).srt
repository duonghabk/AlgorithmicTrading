00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello friends in this lecture video we will create a virtual environment they will perform all the work

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,010
related to this particular course.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,130
Now you may ask what on earth is this what you will enlightenment.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,730
So when you installed Anaconda in the previous lecture would you and when you open Anaconda prompt you

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,330
will see a base and inherit it.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,890
So that means that Anaconda has created a base environment for you right.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,340
So now which whichever library you want to install right.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,610
It will be installed in the base environment.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,800
Right.

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,740
So what can go wrong with that.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,280
So say you are working on different projects one data science project one a conference project right.

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,870
One a physics project.

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,740
The problem is that if you start a library say six months ago and now you have started working on a

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,210
quant finance project and now you want to install another library.

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,810
Right.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,830
The problem is that this new library may have a dependence on the previous library that you are already

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,700
in start.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,080
Right.

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,880
But when you install this new library it will install a newer version.

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,030
The latest version of the library that you had in started six months ago.

21
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,590
So the code that you have written six months ago on based on the library that you just installed it

22
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,510
may not work right.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:34,410
Because whenever new libraries happen function calls keep getting placated or they keep making changes.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:42,630
That's the problem with open source libraries is that the the new version release your code may not

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,410
run.

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:43,980
That's the problem.

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:50,080
So it's always recommended that you create different environments for different projects that you're

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,640
working on.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,460
Right.

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,730
And creating new virtual environment is a child's play these days.

31
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,660
So just use this command gonna create name or name of the virtual environment.

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,560
So let's call it go on top.

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,520
You can have whatever name that you want right.

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,830
And then you will have to mention which Python do you want to use.

35
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,640
Right.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,280
So by and three point eight I think poisoned by ten point nine has already been released.

37
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,160
But I'll go with Python three point eight because it's a stable vision.

38
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,290
I typically not go with the latest version of Python.

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,150
I typically go will with the last stable version.

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,400
Right.

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,860
It's just a hybrid.

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:40,140
So once we run this command you will see that it's the new what is the current version of and you can

43
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:48,350
get a newer version I don't really want in your version and as you can see it is telling you that the

44
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,550
following packages will be downloaded if you want to create this virtual environment.

45
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:58,230
So these are the libraries that will be installed by default.

46
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,530
When you create this new watch will environment right.

47
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,810
So when you will at the end of this you know when we create this virtual environment you would already

48
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,290
have these libraries in the start.

49
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,070
And what are these libraries.

50
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:17,360
PIP by ten three point eight set up dos askew light like these are some of the basic libraries that

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,940
you need to create any watch your environment.

52
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,480
Right.

53
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:28,730
So I will give it this so I'll just say yes and I'll hit enter and now it will install all these libraries

54
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,920
and the dependencies.

55
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,690
So I am going to follow this lecture with you.

56
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,820
So as you can see all these libraries have been started and your environment has been created.

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,330
Hooray.

58
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,140
Congratulations.

59
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,810
You have created a brand new watchful environment.

60
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,830
And you can see that Kaunda is prompting you some of the commands right.

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,810
So what it's saying that by default if you open Anaconda prompt it will open in the base environment

62
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,550
right.

63
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,600
All you'll have to do to kind of activate an environment is to run this command gone to activate the

64
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,110
name of the environment.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,110
But before that let me actually show you how you can get the list off all the environments that you

66
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,120
have created in your system right.

67
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,070
That's pretty straightforward.

68
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:28,210
All you will have to do is run this command right Kaunda info to hyphens and right.

69
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,350
It will tell you all the environments that are installed in your system right.

70
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,900
So I have four environments right.

71
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:42,050
And most of my work is to finance related so most of my you can see that everything is pretty much dedicated

72
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,730
to the same area.

73
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,340
Right.

74
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:43,800
So.

75
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,190
So how do you activate the second environment that you've already created.

76
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,210
All you'll have to do is do gonna activate it.

77
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,910
Right.

78
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,870
And million run it you will see that now my environment is one.

79
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,170
Right.

80
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,330
So now if you install something right.

81
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:08,360
So now if you do a pip install or corner install whatever right now that liability will be installed

82
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,440
in the want virtual environment.

83
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,200
Right.

84
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,200
The fullest library that you need to install is the idea.

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,850
Right.

86
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,780
There are a number of ideas like spider like Jupiter notebook like by John.

87
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,730
Right.

88
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,590
I would strongly recommend you that you install spider.

89
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,170
Right.

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,050
So one venue downloaded and one you when you installed Anaconda.

91
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,480
Spider this is the icon of spider Idi.

92
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,630
It was already installed in your system in the base environment by default.

93
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:40,910
Right.

94
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,930
But we won't be able to use that because we have created a new watchful environment.

95
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,320
So we'll have to install spider I.D. as well.

96
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:56,650
And every time again like I mention just Google how to install a library you watch the come on must

97
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:02,630
do this pip installed a core nine install rate but because we have created this environment in Canada

98
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,560
I would recommend that install packages using corn right.

99
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,220
So let us see what is

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,080
come on Falcon 9 stole spider right.

101
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,960
So if we go to the command that is required right.

102
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,960
So gonna install minus C and a car and a spider.

103
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,680
So let me on this.

104
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,150
So.

105
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,800
So once you have installed your I.D. indicate a spider.

106
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,670
The way to launch it is that once you have activated your watch will environment.

107
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,200
Just type spider and press enter.

108
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,900
Right.

109
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,470
The problem is that for example if I run it I'll get an ETA.

110
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,130
Why.

111
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,950
Because I already have an instance of spider running right.

112
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,370
So it's saying that spider is already running.

113
00:06:51,500 --> 00:07:00,350
So if you have launched the spider IP from any other environment trade so you will have to run this

114
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,360
command spider new instance.

115
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,350
Right.

116
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:13,070
So if you launch this right if you will run this then a new instance of spider will be launched for

117
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,840
your particular environment.

118
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,110
Great.

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,290
So just keep that in mind.

120
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:25,360
In addition you will have to install mean libraries popular libraries like pandas like pip install Panda.

121
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,060
What else.

122
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,630
No.

123
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,450
So not people being startled when you install pandas anyways.

124
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,250
Right.

125
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,850
Mac block liberate.

126
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,770
So as we will progress to the cause I will tell you which libraries to install.

127
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,010
And please just open your Anaconda prompt enter the virtual environment.

128
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,660
If you have created the virtual environment and then install whatever library are talking about.

129
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:47,900
Great.

130
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:54,770
When you are installing a particular library just keep one thing in mind that if you say run corner

131
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:01,570
installed by another whatever and if you run this particular command it will install the latest was

132
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,790
one of pandas in your system right.

133
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:12,830
I would strongly urge you that you use the same version of the library that I have used while creating

134
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,410
this particular course.

135
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:15,800
Why.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:23,000
Because if you use a different version did like we've discussed before the different version can have

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,110
certain changes that will impact the code that I share.

138
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,770
Right.

139
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,560
So if you can troubleshoot that's great but it will save both of us a lot of time.

140
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,780
If you're using the same library version that I use right.

141
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:45,170
So all you have to do is just use a double equal to and then just provide whichever version I am using

142
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:52,100
so I'll give you a list of library versions that I have used it would be great if you can install the

143
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,810
same versions when you're installing the library.

144
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,560
You also need to if you want to deactivate this particular environment if you want to come out of this

145
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:12,710
environment I disclosed this or just do Condor the Activate Kwan right on and it will go back to base.

146
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,450
So we just gonna deactivate

147
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,450
I typically don't use this command like this closer.

148
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,940
Right.

149
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,840
So you see that we have come back to Guan right.

150
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,370
So this is how we create a virtual environment.

151
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,710
If you don't want to create virtual environment that's fine.

152
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,420
Even with the base environment you should be fine.

153
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,770
But if you created that slightly better.

154
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,130
And I would recommend you to create it right.

155
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,730
Because that will help you a while a lot of backward compatibility issues and some other issues that

156
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,690
you may face.

157
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,490
But even if you don't create a virtual environment that's fine.

158
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:47,750
Right.

159
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,090
So if you have if you're facing any problem pertaining to creating virtual environment posted in the

160
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,430
Q and A section and I'll do my best to resolve it.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,540
Thanks a lot.

162
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,960
I'll see you in the next lecture video.
